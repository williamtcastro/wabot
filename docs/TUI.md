```

The focused panel has a green border.

- **Chat list** (left): every conversation the bot has stored, most recent first, with the
  last message and a relative time (`14:05`, `Yesterday`, `Mon`, `02/10/26`). A green badge
  counts unread messages (see [Unread](#unread)); it survives restarts, and **All activity**
  shows how many chats have new messages. `▌` marks the open chat, `👥` a group, and `~Name` means the person isn't in your
  address book and that's their WhatsApp profile name. **All activity** at the top is a live
  feed of every chat. Group names come from a cache in the database, so they show right away at
  startup (even offline); they're refreshed in the background on connect and every 10 minutes.
- **Conversation** (right): the open chat's last 400 messages, updating live, with day
  separators. Only that chat's messages are shown, not the same person's messages in groups.
  Your messages are right-aligned and green, others on the left. In groups each sender's name
  is shown in its own color. Replies show the quoted message above them (`┃`), or
  `┃ ↩ reply to an earlier message` when the quoted message isn't among the loaded ones.
  Reactions appear after the message, set off by a `│` divider, before the time
  (`bora!  │ ❤️ 👍2  21:41 ✓`); removed reactions disappear along with the divider. Edited or
  deleted messages are marked. Media shows as a label: `📷 Photo`, `🎥 Video`, `🎤 Voice message`, `💟 Sticker`,
  `📄 file name · size`, `📍 location`.
- **Context bar** (above the input, only when needed): `↩ Replying to Maria …`, `✎ Editing …`, or
  the command hint bar while you type a command (see [Autocomplete](#autocomplete)).
- **Input**: plain text goes to the open chat; lines starting with `/` are commands.
- Text from other people (messages, names, file names) is shown with terminal escape codes,
  control characters and bidi overrides removed, so a message can't redraw your screen or
  disguise its text.
- **Footer**: key hints for the focused panel, or the last notice (`✓ saved …`, `✗ error`)
  for 5 seconds. On the right, a dot shows the connection: green with your number when
  connected and logged in, red with the state otherwise.

The chat list comes from messages stored in the database (`~/.config/wame/wame.db` by default), so it fills up as you use the bot.
Right after a fresh `wame login`, WhatsApp also sends a batch of recent conversations, which
are imported automatically.

## Unread

Each chat has a read position stored in the database (`wame_chat_state`). The sidebar badge
counts incoming messages after it (reactions and deleted messages don't count). A chat becomes
read when:

- you open it in the TUI. This is saved locally right away, even when offline;
- you send a message in it;
- you run `/read` (or a client calls `POST /read`);
- you read it on your phone or another linked device (WhatsApp tells wame through "read-self"
  receipts).

When you open a chat that has unread messages, a `── 2 new messages ──` divider appears above the
first one. After upgrading from a version without this feature, everything already stored counts as
read, and so does history imported after a fresh login.

**Read receipts.** Opening a chat also sends read receipts for its latest incoming messages (up
to 20) when you're connected, and new messages that arrive in the open chat are marked as read
right away. Your contacts see blue ticks as if you'd read them on the phone.

## Keys

This is the `/help` panel, word for word:

```
Moving around
  Tab / Shift+Tab     cycle focus: input → chats → messages
  Ctrl+J / Ctrl+K     next / previous chat (from anywhere)
  ↑ (empty input)     select messages
  Ctrl+D / Ctrl+U     scroll half a page down / up
  Ctrl+Y              copy the open chat's number (group ID for groups)
  PgUp / PgDn         scroll
  Esc                 cancel / close / back to the input

Chat list (focused)
  type                filter chats by name
  ↑ ↓  Enter          pick and open

Selected message
  j k  ↑ ↓           move               g  G   first / last
  r  reply           e  edit (yours, 20 min)
  d d  delete        s  save media to ~/Downloads
  1-6  react 👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 🙏     0  remove reaction
  other letters      back to typing

Commands
  /to <name|number|jid>     open a chat
  /search <words>           search every chat (↑↓ pick, Enter jumps to it, Esc closes)
  /copy                     copy this chat's number (same as Ctrl+Y)
  /all                      live feed of every chat
  /contacts [search]        your address book
  /name [text]              your name for the open chat (alone: clear it)
  /tag clients vip          set its tags; /tag +vip -old edits them, alone clears
  /groups                   your groups
  /send <number|jid> <msg>  one-off message
  /file <path> [caption]    send a file to the open chat
  /read                     mark the open chat as read
  /pair <phone>             log in with a pairing code
  /help  /quit

Typing a command, Tab completes it (and names after /to, numbers after /send,
paths after /file, the current name after /name), ↑ ↓ or Ctrl+J / Ctrl+K cycle
the matches.
```

Details:

- **Focus.** `Tab` cycles input → chats → messages, `Shift+Tab` goes backwards. The messages
  panel is skipped when no chat is open or it has no messages.
- **Chat list.** Typing filters by name (or part of the JID); `Backspace` edits the filter, the
  first `Esc` clears it and the second goes back to the input. `↑` `↓` move the highlight and
  `Enter` opens the highlighted chat. Letters always go to the filter, so `j` / `k` don't move here.
- **Switching chats.** `Ctrl+J` / `Ctrl+K` open the chat after / before the open one from
  anywhere, without changing focus. When the chat list is focused they step from the highlighted
  chat instead (and move the highlight with it). Going up past the first chat opens **All
  activity**. While you're typing a command with completions, they cycle the completions instead
  (see [Autocomplete](#autocomplete)). Many terminals send `Ctrl+J` as a line feed; wame tells it
  apart from `Enter`, so `Enter` still sends.
- **Scrolling.** `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` scroll the conversation (or an open panel) half a page down /
  up whatever is focused; `PgDn` / `PgUp` scroll a full page. They don't edit the input.
- **Selecting messages.** `↑` in an empty input selects the newest message. Move with `j` / `k`
  (or `↓` `↑`); `g` jumps to the first loaded message and `G` to the newest. `j` or `↓` past the
  newest message returns to the input. `Enter` also starts a reply.
  Any other letter jumps back to the input and is typed there, so you can just start writing.
- **Reply / edit.** `r` or `e` puts you back in the input with a context bar. For an edit the
  input is pre-filled with the current text. `Enter` sends, `Esc` cancels. Deleted messages
  can't be replied to. Only your own text messages can be edited, and only within 20 minutes of
  sending (WhatsApp's limit).
- **Delete.** Press `d` twice on the same message. It's deleted for everyone.
- **React.** `1`–`6` react with 👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 🙏, `0` removes your reaction.
- **Save.** `s` downloads the photo, video, voice message, sticker or document to
  `~/Downloads` (or the current directory if that doesn't exist), readable only by you (mode
  0600). Existing files are never overwritten: the copy is saved as `name (1).ext`,
  `name (2).ext` and so on.
- **Panels.** `/help`, `/contacts` and `/groups` open in the right-hand pane. `↑` `↓` and
  `PgUp` `PgDn` scroll them, `Esc` closes them.
- **Search.** `/search <words>` replaces the right-hand pane with up to 200 matching messages
  from every chat, newest first (date, chat, sender, text). `↑` `↓`, `j` `k` or `Ctrl+J` `Ctrl+K`
  move, `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` or `PgDn` / `PgUp` page, `g` / `G` or `Home` / `End` jump to the first /
  last result, `Enter` opens that chat with the message
  selected (loading further back if needed), and `Esc` or `q` closes the results. Matching follows
  the API's [`q` rule](API.md#filters): every word must match a whole word, the last one as a
  prefix (`bom di` finds "bom dia"); case and accents are ignored; deleted messages aren't found.
- `Ctrl+C` quits, as do `/quit` and `/q`.

## Autocomplete

While the input starts with `/`:

- A **hint bar** above the input lists the commands matching what you've typed so far, with
  their arguments and a short description (`/to <name|number>  open a chat · …`). An unknown
  command shows `no such command`. The bar goes away once you type a space after the command.
- The best match appears as grey ghost text after the cursor. **`Tab`** accepts it; `↑` / `↓`
  or `Ctrl+J` / `Ctrl+K` cycle through the other matches. If nothing matches, `Tab` does nothing (it doesn't move
  focus).
- Completion knows the arguments too:
  - `/to `: names of your chats and address-book contacts, the number for chats without a
    contact name, and group JIDs.
  - `/send `: numbers and group JIDs of your chats.
  - `/name `: the open chat's current name, to edit it (only for a person, and not when it's only a
    push name, a number or a bare JID).
  - `/file `: files and folders on disk, relative to the current directory or starting with
    `~/`. Hidden files only show up once you type a `.`; names containing spaces are skipped
    (`/file` can't take them anyway).

Outside a command, `Tab` keeps its normal job of cycling focus.

Everything you send from the TUI goes through the same rate limiter as the API and is recorded
in the audit log with actor `tui` (including `/pair`).

## Commands

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `/to <number, JID or name>` | open a chat. A name works if exactly one contact matches; otherwise you get the matches |
| `/search <words>` | search every chat; see **Search** above |
| `/all` | go back to **All activity** |
| `/contacts [search]` | list your contacts, optionally filtered by name or part of the number |
| `/name [text]` | your own name for the open chat. It wins over the phone's address book and the person's push name everywhere: the chat list, the API, the admin panel. `/name` alone clears it. Never sent to WhatsApp or the phone |
| `/tag <tags>` | `/tag clients vip` sets the open chat's tags, `/tag +vip -old` adds and removes some, `/tag` alone clears them. Tags are lowercase letters, digits, `-` and `_`. They show dimmed after the name above the conversation |
| `/groups` | list your groups with their JIDs |
| `/send <number or JID> <text>` | one-off message without switching chats |
| `/file <path> [caption]` | send a file to the open chat (images go as photos, the rest as documents). `~/` expands to your home directory |
| `/copy` | copy the open chat's number (`+5521987654321`), or the group ID for groups; same as `Ctrl+Y` |
| `/read` | mark the open chat as read (read receipts for the latest 50 incoming messages, and the whole chat locally) |
| `/pair <phone>` | pairing-code login |
| `/help` | keys and commands |
| `/quit`, `/q` | exit |

## Notes

- Only one process can use a session at a time. Stop `wame serve` before starting the TUI,
  or run `wame tui -addr 127.0.0.1:8080` to get both.
- Logs are silenced in the TUI so they don't mess up the screen. Pass `-log-file wame.log` to
  keep the app logs (HTTP requests, actions, webhook deliveries). whatsmeow's own logs stay off;
  to see them, run `wame serve -debug` with the same `-db` instead.
- File paths in `/file` can't contain spaces.
- `/name` and `/tag` work offline and only on people (not groups); both are in the audit log with
  actor `tui` (field names only, never the values). The same list is edited from the API and the
  admin panel's Contacts tab.
- New commands go in `tuiCommands`, `tuiHelp` (in `internal/tui/commands.go`) and this file, so autocomplete,
  the hint bar and `/help` stay in sync.
- WhatsApp sometimes identifies people by a hidden ID (`…@lid`) instead of their number,
  e.g. for messages you type on your phone. Until WhatsApp reveals which number that ID
  belongs to, the person can show up as a separate chat. The two merge automatically as soon
  as the link is known, usually with their next message.
